# Group work: Predicting salary of the US data scientists

In this project we will try to analyze and predict the salary of US data scientists. Our analysis is based on the publicly available analysis in Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/code/mabs003/predicting-salary-of-data-scientists/notebook). Our main aim is first to reproduce the results of the original analysis using R and then improve the study by updating the data and adding Random Forest for the prediction.
