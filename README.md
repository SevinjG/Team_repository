# Group work: Predicting salary of the US data scientists

Our project is about predicting the salary of US data scientists. We choose this topic and data from Kaggle. You can get it from:[here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mabs003/predicting-salary-of-data-scientists)
In the Kaggle the codes were written in Python and we converted the codes from Python to R which was one of our tasks in this project. If you look at the Original Research in our GitHub repository, you can see the comments about the written codes: how they work, their results, etc. 
After converting the codes to R we tried the same codes on updated new data( kaggle_survey_2022_resposes.csv). In this process, we faced some errors but all of them have been corrected. Additionally, we add a new model: Random Forrest to our project and showed the necessary results.
